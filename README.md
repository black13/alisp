# ALisp

![img](./logo.png)


## Abstract

ALisp is a interpreted [Lisp Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) language. I&rsquo;ve developed it on my own around 2019-2020. This is my first try in language design and I have focused on simplicity and ease of development. The design follows relatively closely the one of [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/). A lot of conventions, syntax and concepts are borrowed from there. ALisp does, however, has it&rsquo;s own features like runtime dynamic modules loading, proper file importing as well as general programming language features that are expected.
